        """Create a new browser pool with the specified configuration and size.

        Pooled
        browsers load their profile read-only: any save_changes on the profile is
        ignored (not rejected), so pooled browsers never persist changes back to the
        profile.

        Args:
          size: Number of browsers to maintain in the pool. The maximum size is determined by
              your organization's pooled sessions limit (the sum of all pool sizes cannot
              exceed your limit).

          chrome_policy: Custom Chrome enterprise policy overrides applied to all browsers in this pool.
              Keys are Chrome enterprise policy names; values must match their expected types.
              Blocked: kernel-managed policies (extensions, proxy, CDP/automation). See
              https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/ The serialized JSON payload is capped
              at 5 MiB.

          extensions: List of browser extensions to load into the session. Provide each by id or name.

          fill_rate_per_minute: Percentage of the pool to fill per minute. Defaults to 25. The cap is 25 for
              most organizations but can be raised per-organization, so only the lower bound
              is enforced here.

          headless: If true, launches the browser using a headless image. Defaults to false.

          kiosk_mode: If true, launches the browser in kiosk mode to hide address bar and tabs in live
              view. Defaults to false.

          name: Optional name for the browser pool. Must be unique within the project.

          network: Network configuration applied to browsers in this pool.

          profile: Profile configuration for browsers in a pool. Provide either id or name.
              Profiles must be created beforehand. Unlike single browser sessions, pools load
              the profile read-only and never persist changes back to it, so save_changes is
              omitted here. Any save_changes value sent on a pool profile is silently ignored
              rather than rejected.

          proxy_id: Optional proxy to associate to the browser session. Must reference a proxy in
              the same project as the browser session.

          refresh_on_profile_update: When true, flush idle browsers when the profile the pool uses is updated, so
              pool browsers pick up the latest profile data. When a profile is provided during
              creation, this defaults to true. Requires a profile to be set on the pool.

          region: Geographic region for the browser pool. It is fixed once the pool is created.
              Region selection requires a Start-Up or Enterprise plan, defaults to us-east
              when omitted on create.

          start_url: Optional URL to navigate to when a new browser is warmed into the pool.
              Best-effort: failures to navigate do not fail pool fill. Only applied to
              newly-warmed browsers; browsers reused via release/acquire keep whatever URL the
              previous lease left them on. Accepts any URL Chromium can resolve, including
              chrome:// pages.

          stealth: If true, launches the browser in stealth mode to reduce detection by anti-bot
              mechanisms. Defaults to false.

          telemetry: Telemetry configuration applied to browsers warmed into this pool. Set enabled
              to true to start capture using the default set, or provide browser category
              settings. If omitted, null, set to an empty object ({}), set to enabled: false
              without browser category settings, or all four CDP categories are explicitly
              disabled, no telemetry is configured on the pool. Only applied to newly-warmed
              browsers.

          timeout_seconds: Default idle timeout in seconds for browsers acquired from this pool before they
              are destroyed. Defaults to 600 seconds. Minimum 10, maximum 259200 (72 hours).

          viewport: Initial browser window size in pixels with optional refresh rate. If omitted,
              image defaults apply (1920x1080@25). For GPU images, the default is
              1920x1080@60. Arbitrary viewport dimensions and refresh rates are accepted.
              Known-good presets include: 2560x1440@10, 1920x1080@25, 1920x1200@25,
              1440x900@25, 1280x800@60, 1024x768@60, 1200x800@60, 768x1024@60, 390x844@60. For
              GPU images, recommended presets use one of these resolutions with refresh rates
              60, 30, 25, or 10: 800x600, 960x720, 1024x576, 1024x768, 1152x648, 1200x800,

        Args:

          discard_all_idle: Whether to discard all idle browsers and rebuild them immediately with the new
              configuration. Defaults to false. Only browsers that are idle when the update
              runs are rebuilt. A browser that is in use during the update keeps its original

              pool with that stale configuration until it is discarded (by this flag on a
              later update, or by flushing the pool).

          extensions: If provided, replaces the extension list. Empty array clears all
              previously-selected extensions. Omit this field to leave extensions unchanged.

          fill_rate_per_minute: If provided, replaces the percentage of the pool to fill per minute. The cap is
              25 for most organizations but can be raised per-organization, so only the lower

          kiosk_mode: If provided, replaces whether browsers launch in kiosk mode.

          name: If provided, replaces the pool name. Empty string is a no-op; the pool name
              cannot be cleared or reset to empty once assigned.

          network: If provided, replaces the pool's network configuration. Omit to leave the
              existing configuration unchanged; an empty object ({}) removes it, while
              network: {private_hosts: []} sets an explicit empty list. Only applied to

          refresh_on_profile_update: If provided, replaces whether idle browsers are flushed when the profile the
              pool uses is updated. When the pool's profile reference is changed (including
              newly attached) and this field is omitted, it defaults to true. Re-sending the
              same profile reference leaves this setting unchanged. Clearing the profile also
              disables this setting. Requires a profile to be set on the pool.

          size: If provided, replaces the number of browsers to maintain in the pool. The
              maximum size is determined by your organization's pooled sessions limit (the sum
              of all pool sizes cannot exceed your limit).

          start_url: If provided, replaces the URL to navigate to when a new browser is warmed into
              the pool. Empty string clears the previously-set URL. Omit this field to leave
              it unchanged.

          stealth: If provided, replaces whether browsers launch in stealth mode.

          telemetry: If provided, updates the pool's telemetry configuration. Omit, set to null, or
              set to an empty object ({}) to leave the existing configuration unchanged. Set
              enabled to true to enable capture using the default set. Set enabled to false to
              clear the pool's telemetry. Provide browser category settings for per-category
              updates, merged onto the pool's current configuration. Only applied to browsers
              warmed after the update; browsers already in the pool keep their configuration
              until discarded.

          timeout_seconds: If provided, replaces the default idle timeout in seconds for browsers acquired
              from this pool before they are destroyed. Minimum 10, maximum 259200 (72 hours).

          viewport: Initial browser window size in pixels with optional refresh rate. If omitted,

        Pooled
        browsers load their profile read-only: any save_changes on the profile is
        ignored (not rejected), so pooled browsers never persist changes back to the
        profile.

        Args:
          size: Number of browsers to maintain in the pool. The maximum size is determined by
              your organization's pooled sessions limit (the sum of all pool sizes cannot
              exceed your limit).

          chrome_policy: Custom Chrome enterprise policy overrides applied to all browsers in this pool.
              Keys are Chrome enterprise policy names; values must match their expected types.
              Blocked: kernel-managed policies (extensions, proxy, CDP/automation). See
              https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/ The serialized JSON payload is capped
              at 5 MiB.

          extensions: List of browser extensions to load into the session. Provide each by id or name.

          fill_rate_per_minute: Percentage of the pool to fill per minute. Defaults to 25. The cap is 25 for
              most organizations but can be raised per-organization, so only the lower bound
              is enforced here.

          headless: If true, launches the browser using a headless image. Defaults to false.

          kiosk_mode: If true, launches the browser in kiosk mode to hide address bar and tabs in live
              view. Defaults to false.

          name: Optional name for the browser pool. Must be unique within the project.

          network: Network configuration applied to browsers in this pool.

          profile: Profile configuration for browsers in a pool. Provide either id or name.
              Profiles must be created beforehand. Unlike single browser sessions, pools load
              the profile read-only and never persist changes back to it, so save_changes is
              omitted here. Any save_changes value sent on a pool profile is silently ignored
              rather than rejected.

          proxy_id: Optional proxy to associate to the browser session. Must reference a proxy in
              the same project as the browser session.

          refresh_on_profile_update: When true, flush idle browsers when the profile the pool uses is updated, so
              pool browsers pick up the latest profile data. When a profile is provided during
              creation, this defaults to true. Requires a profile to be set on the pool.

          region: Geographic region for the browser pool. It is fixed once the pool is created.
              Region selection requires a Start-Up or Enterprise plan, defaults to us-east
              when omitted on create.

          start_url: Optional URL to navigate to when a new browser is warmed into the pool.
              Best-effort: failures to navigate do not fail pool fill. Only applied to
              newly-warmed browsers; browsers reused via release/acquire keep whatever URL the
              previous lease left them on. Accepts any URL Chromium can resolve, including
              chrome:// pages.

          stealth: If true, launches the browser in stealth mode to reduce detection by anti-bot
              mechanisms. Defaults to false.

          telemetry: Telemetry configuration applied to browsers warmed into this pool. Set enabled
              to true to start capture using the default set, or provide browser category
              settings. If omitted, null, set to an empty object ({}), set to enabled: false
              without browser category settings, or all four CDP categories are explicitly
              disabled, no telemetry is configured on the pool. Only applied to newly-warmed
              browsers.

          timeout_seconds: Default idle timeout in seconds for browsers acquired from this pool before they
              are destroyed. Defaults to 600 seconds. Minimum 10, maximum 259200 (72 hours).

          viewport: Initial browser window size in pixels with optional refresh rate. If omitted,
              image defaults apply (1920x1080@25). For GPU images, the default is
              1920x1080@60. Arbitrary viewport dimensions and refresh rates are accepted.
              Known-good presets include: 2560x1440@10, 1920x1080@25, 1920x1200@25,
              1440x900@25, 1280x800@60, 1024x768@60, 1200x800@60, 768x1024@60, 390x844@60. For
              GPU images, recommended presets use one of these resolutions with refresh rates
              60, 30, 25, or 10: 800x600, 960x720, 1024x576, 1024x768, 1152x648, 1200x800,

        `profile: { "id": "" }`. Clearing the profile also disables
        `refresh_on_profile_update`.

        Args:
          chrome_policy: If provided, replaces the custom Chrome enterprise policy overrides applied to
              all browsers in this pool. Empty object clears any previously-set policy. Keys
              are Chrome enterprise policy names; values must match their expected types.
              Blocked: kernel-managed policies (extensions, proxy, CDP/automation). See
              https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/ The serialized JSON payload is capped
              at 5 MiB.

          discard_all_idle: Whether to discard all idle browsers and rebuild them immediately with the new
              configuration. Defaults to false. Only browsers that are idle when the update
              runs are rebuilt. A browser that is in use during the update keeps its original
              configuration, and if it is later released with `reuse: true` it returns to the
              pool with that stale configuration until it is discarded (by this flag on a
              later update, or by flushing the pool).

          extensions: If provided, replaces the extension list. Empty array clears all
              previously-selected extensions. Omit this field to leave extensions unchanged.

          fill_rate_per_minute: If provided, replaces the percentage of the pool to fill per minute. The cap is
              25 for most organizations but can be raised per-organization, so only the lower
              bound is enforced here.

          headless: If provided, replaces whether browsers launch using a headless image.

          kiosk_mode: If provided, replaces whether browsers launch in kiosk mode.

          name: If provided, replaces the pool name. Empty string is a no-op; the pool name
              cannot be cleared or reset to empty once assigned.

          network: If provided, replaces the pool's network configuration. Omit to leave the
              existing configuration unchanged; an empty object ({}) removes it, while
              network: {private_hosts: []} sets an explicit empty list. Only applied to
              browsers created in the pool after the update; browsers already in the pool keep
              their configuration until discarded (see discard_all_idle).

          profile: Profile configuration for browsers in a pool. Provide either id or name.
              Profiles must be created beforehand. Unlike single browser sessions, pools load
              the profile read-only and never persist changes back to it, so save_changes is
              omitted here. Any save_changes value sent on a pool profile is silently ignored
              rather than rejected.

          proxy_id: Empty string clears the previously-selected proxy. Omit this field to leave the
              proxy unchanged.

          refresh_on_profile_update: If provided, replaces whether idle browsers are flushed when the profile the
              pool uses is updated. When the pool's profile reference is changed (including
              newly attached) and this field is omitted, it defaults to true. Re-sending the
              same profile reference leaves this setting unchanged. Clearing the profile also
              disables this setting. Requires a profile to be set on the pool.

          size: If provided, replaces the number of browsers to maintain in the pool. The
              maximum size is determined by your organization's pooled sessions limit (the sum
              of all pool sizes cannot exceed your limit).

          start_url: If provided, replaces the URL to navigate to when a new browser is warmed into
              the pool. Empty string clears the previously-set URL. Omit this field to leave
              it unchanged.

          stealth: If provided, replaces whether browsers launch in stealth mode.

          telemetry: If provided, updates the pool's telemetry configuration. Omit, set to null, or
              set to an empty object ({}) to leave the existing configuration unchanged. Set
              enabled to true to enable capture using the default set. Set enabled to false to
              clear the pool's telemetry. Provide browser category settings for per-category
              updates, merged onto the pool's current configuration. Only applied to browsers
              warmed after the update; browsers already in the pool keep their configuration
              until discarded.

          timeout_seconds: If provided, replaces the default idle timeout in seconds for browsers acquired
              from this pool before they are destroyed. Minimum 10, maximum 259200 (72 hours).

          viewport: Initial browser window size in pixels with optional refresh rate. If omitted,
              image defaults apply (1920x1080@25). For GPU images, the default is
              1920x1080@60. Arbitrary viewport dimensions and refresh rates are accepted.
              Known-good presets include: 2560x1440@10, 1920x1080@25, 1920x1200@25,
              1440x900@25, 1280x800@60, 1024x768@60, 1200x800@60, 768x1024@60, 390x844@60. For
              GPU images, recommended presets use one of these resolutions with refresh rates
              60, 30, 25, or 10: 800x600, 960x720, 1024x576, 1024x768, 1152x648, 1200x800,
              1280x720, 1368x768, 1440x900, 1600x900, 1920x1080, 1920x1200, 390x844, 360x250,
              768x1024, 800x1600. Viewports outside this list may exhibit unstable live view
              or recording behavior. If refresh_rate is not provided, it will be automatically
              determined based on the resolution (higher resolutions use lower refresh rates
              to keep bandwidth reasonable).
