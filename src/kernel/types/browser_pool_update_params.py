    Whether to discard all idle browsers and rebuild them immediately with the new
    configuration. Defaults to false. Only browsers that are idle when the update
    runs are rebuilt. A browser that is in use during the update keeps its original
    configuration, and if it is later released with `reuse: true` it returns to the
    pool with that stale configuration until it is discarded (by this flag on a
    later update, or by flushing the pool).

    60, 30, 25, or 10: 800x600, 960x720, 1024x576, 1024x768, 1152x648, 1200x800,

    or recording behavior. If refresh_rate is not provided, it will be automatically
    determined based on the resolution (higher resolutions use lower refresh rates
    to keep bandwidth reasonable).
